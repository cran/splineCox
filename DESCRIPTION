Description: Implements a two-stage estimation approach for Cox 
    regression using five-parameter M-spline functions to model the baseline hazard. It allows
    for flexible hazard shapes and model selection based on log-likelihood criteria as described in
    Teranishi et al.(2025).
    In addition, the package provides functions for constructing and evaluating B-spline copulas 
    based on five M-spline or I-spline basis functions, allowing users to flexibly model and 
    compute bivariate dependence structures. Both the copula function and its density can be evaluated.
    Furthermore, the package supports computation of dependence measures such as Kendall's tau and 
    Spearman's rho, derived analytically from the copula parameters.
